# Portfolio-Risk-And-Return-Analyzer
This application allows you to analyze the risk of portfolios by calculating the standard deviation, variance, covariance, and Sharpe ratios.  These calculations can then be used to compare the volatility between portfolios along with the amount of return per risk factor.  The calculated data can then be plotted so that it is easier to read at a glimpse.

## Technologies
In order to run this code you will need to import pandas, numpy, Path from pathlib, and matplotlib inline.

## Installation Guide
This is how to import the necessary libraries and dependencies:

## Usage
### Import and clean data to only show daily returns

### Analyze performance based on cumulative returns

### Analyze the risk by calculating the standard deviation of each portfolio

### Analyze the risk-return profile by calculating the Sharpe ratios of each portfolio
Sharpe Ratios = Annualized Average Return / Annualized Standard Deviation

### Diversify the portfolio by calculating the variance, covariance, and beta
Here are examples of two portfolios I compared:
